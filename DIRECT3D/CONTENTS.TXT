InitialProject :
    completed initial project d3dBasic. Class CD3DPolygonFrame
    is introduced.

Polyhedral3DObjects :
   project d3dVillage - village is shown in perspective projection.

OrthoView :
   project d3dVillage - village is shown in ortho projection.

IntroOfGeomArsenal :
   project d3dVillage - village is shown in perspective projection.
   Class d3dGeomArsenal is used.

Smooth3DObjects :
   project d3dMushroom - 3 Mushrooms in air.

RadarAndArrows : 
   project d3dMushroom - a scene, consisting of a radar and 
   3 different arrows in air.

AmbientLight :
   project d3dLights - only ambient light. ToolBar of the application 
   includes new button (4-th from the left). Please try it.

DirectionalLight :
   project d3dLights - ambient light + directional light.

PointLight :
   project d3dLights - ambient light + point light.

PointLightAndChessboard :
   project d3dLights - ambient light + point light.
   Landscape plane consists of many small facets.
   Experiments with attenuation are commented 
   in lines of file d3dLightsObj.cpp

ParallelPointLight :
   project d3dLights - ambient light + parallel point light.

Fog :
   project d3dLights = Fog + PointLight + ChessBoard as landscape
                       + farther decoration + BKG viewport image

ShadowSceneWithoutShadows :
   project d3dShadow - a scene before applications of shadows.

Shadow :
   project d3dShadow - the same scene with shadows.

Shadow2 :
   project d3dShadow - a scene with a complex structure of frames.

Decal :
   project d3dDecal - usage of decals inside 3D scenes. Image file
   "Decal.bmp" must be present in directory "data".

StaticWrapsAndTextures :
   project d3dWrap - usage of flat and cylindrical wraps. Necessary
   textures image files are present in directory "data". Chrome wrap 
   is not used here.

StaticChromeWrap :
   project d3dWrap - one time application of chrome wrap to a Mushroom.
   Additional experiment is commented in file "d3dWrapObj.cpp". 
   Experiments show dependencies of picture on "reference frame" parameter.

SimpleDynamics :
   project d3dDyna - usage of frame's intrinsic rotation and motion
   velocities. Callback function is used also.

MoonLightShadowsAndMovingSearchLight :
   project d3dLights = landscape is textured with grass +
                       rotating radar +
                       rotating searchlight.

ChromeWrapAndDynamics :
   project d3dChromeWrap - an example of right usage of chrome wrap
   if the scene has dynamic changes.

Animation :
   project d3dAnim - application of the given animation sequence of events.

ControlViaMousePick :
   project d3dPick - usage of a mouse in order to control the appearance
   of 3D scene.

PickAndDynamics :
   project d3dPick - usage of 3D pick in dynamic 3D scene.

Sweeping :
   d3dVillage - construction of complex 3D object via sweeping operation.
   
Revolution :
   d3dVillage - construction of complex 3D objects as a body of revolution.
   Several objects penerate each other while moving.
